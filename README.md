# PiClusterResearch
Contains code, past publications, our paper, presentation and pictures from our 8 node Raspberry Pi Cluster research project

We built an eight node Raspberry Pi cluster computer which uses a distributed memory architecture. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate that Raspberry Piâ€™s have the potential to be a cost effective educational tool to teach students about parallel processing. With the cluster we built, we ran experiments using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard as well as multiprocessing implemented in Python. Our experiments revolve around how efficiency in computing increases or decreases with different parallel processing techniques. We tested this by implementing a Monte Carlo calculation of Pi. We ran the experiments with eight nodes and one through four processes per node. For a comparison, we also ran the computations on a desktop computer. Our primary goal was to demonstrate how Raspberry Pis are an effective, yet comparatively cheap solution for learning about parallel processing.
